		<h1> <u>Hobbies</u> </h1>
			<p> I'm not of man of many hobbies. Working full-time <em>and</em> attending college <s>full-time</s> part-time don't leave me a lot of time for myself.
			I'd say my main hobby is playing video games and that's how I spend most of my weekends. If I can't find something to play, I like
			to relax by watching all different kinds of movies. <br /> I enjoy movies that make me think and take a bit more patience and attention span,
			basically the <i>boring</i> stuff. </p>
			<p> When I'm burnt out on games, I like to just get out and go!</p>

		<h1> <u>Travel</u> </h1>
			<p>
			 I had a fun time this Summer going all kinds of places and try new things.
			 <blockquote>
			 	<p> <q>When is the last time you did something for the first time</q> </p>
			 </blockquote>
			 <p>I got to see a lot of cool places during Summer break. I was able to visit Santa Monica and Santa Monica Pier this July 4<sup>th</sup> for the first time.
			 	That same day me and my family spent the day in Downtown <abbr title="Los Angeles">LA</abbr> watching fireworks go <b>BOOM</b>.

		<h1> <u>Career Goals</u> </h1>
			<p> I hope that my experience here in college will get a career in programming as my goal is to ultimately make software and to learn how the video games I like so 
				much work. </p>
			<hr />
		<h1> <u>Family</u> </h1>
			<p> My family consists of my 2 siblings, my Mother and I, and they all mean the world to me. I hope that through my education I will be able to get a career where I 
				can comfortably support all of them whenever they might need help. </p>
